# Sustainable Recycling App - Design Onboarding

This repository is part of the design onboarding project for the Sustainable Recycling App. It includes various design documents, personas, and wireframes used during the ideation and development process.

## Project Overview

The **Sustainable Recycling App** is designed to make recycling simple, efficient, and rewarding for users. The app helps users by automatically recognizing materials, providing clear recycling instructions, visualizing their environmental impact, and encouraging ongoing participation through a reward system.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Material Recognition**: Recognizes discarded items and offers appropriate recycling instructions.
- **Simplified UI/UX**: Users can recycle quickly with just a few clicks, without complex procedures.
- **Environmental Impact Visualization**: Users can see how their recycling efforts reduce carbon emissions.
- **Reward System**: Users earn points and badges for each recycling action, motivating continuous participation.

## Files Included

This repository contains the following design documents and wireframes:

- `practical_ideationis.pdf`: Describes the current (As-is) and future (To-be) states of recycling practices and user experiences.
- `5_whys.pdf`: Root cause analysis using the "5 Whys" technique to address common recycling challenges.
- `target_persona.pdf`: Detailed user persona representing the target audience for the app, including needs and behaviors.
- `interview.pdf`: Interview questions and results regarding recycling habits and the difficulties users face.
- `golden_circle.pdf`: Provides the core vision and motivation for the app based on the Golden Circle framework.
- `wire_frame_basic.pdf`: A basic wireframe demonstrating the app's structure and layout, focusing on core functionality.
- `wire_frame.pdf`: High-fidelity wireframe providing detailed screens for the app's design, including user flows, UI/UX elements, and functionality.

## Wireframe Features (from `wire_frame.pdf`):
- **Carbon Emission Reduction**: Shows the amount of carbon emissions saved by the user's recycling efforts.
- **Reward System**: Displays badges and points earned for recycling, fostering a sense of achievement.
- **Material Recognition**: AI-based recognition system that identifies the material of discarded items and provides proper recycling instructions.
- **Simple Interface**: Designed for ease of use, allowing users to perform recycling tasks with minimal effort.
- **Visualized Achievements**: Users can track their recycling success through visual metrics such as reduced carbon emissions and points.
